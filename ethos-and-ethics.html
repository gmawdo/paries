        <h1 class="p-header-text">Ethos & Ethics</h1>
        <p>Data in the digital age is what fossil fuels were in the industrial age. It is what drives the global economy. Paries was founded and built on three underpinning
            principles: the inalienable rights of individuals and entities to privacy, security, and control of their data. We strive to support these principles daily
            in what we do, what we make, and what we sell.</p>
        
        <h2 class="p-header-text">Duties of Care & Loyalty</h2>
        <p>Duty of Care is our commitment to act fairly for the long-term benefits of all our stakeholders, whether shareholders, customers, employees, or partners.
            Duty of Loyalty is our obligation to act in a manner that is always in the sole and best interests of the company.
        </p>

        <h2 class="p-header-text">Ethical Hacking</h2>
        <p>As a company operating in the security domain, we may engage in white hat hacking activities while consulting for customers or third parties, or while
            testing our own products and services to expose cyber vulnerabilities. Any Paries hacking activities will be consistent with the
            Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) credentialing, such as GCHQ GCT, ANSI 17024, and/or US DoD Directive 8570.</p>
        
        <h2 class="p-header-text">IT</h2>
        <p>Paries’ IT embraces industry-leading cybersecurity principles such as “Zero Trust Networks” and “Software Defined Perimeter,” or other methodologies restricting access on a
            “need-to-know” basis, and multi-factor or ZKP authentication. These policies are regularly reviewed and updated by the management team.</p>
        <p>To foster the most secure environment, all Paries employees will be restricted to using only selected Linux servers, selected Mac laptops, selected iPhone and iPad
            tablets, and de-Googled Android phones, all of which use only company-approved applications. Of course, we also use Paries products and services in the execution of
            our work (e.g. VerifiedVault).</p>
        
        <h2 class="p-header-text">Customers & Partners</h2>
        <p>Paries remains committed to its customers and partners for the long term. The technology industry is built around ecosystems that must work together to create sustainable solutions.
            As a for-profit entity, we strive to achieve the optimum short, medium, and long-term profitability for our shareholders while working closely and in a balanced way
            with customers and partners to ensure their businesses are also sustainable in the longer term.</p>

        <h2 class="p-header-text">Our Team</h2>
        <p>We are planning on growing the team, and as an intellectual capital company, our people and our culture are our greatest assets. We believe in meritocracy, rewarding results, and investing in our talent to
            develop our team’s potential to the fullest.</p>
